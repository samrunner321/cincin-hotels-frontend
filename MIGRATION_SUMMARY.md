# Import Path Migration Summary

## Overview

This project implements a systematic migration from alias-based imports to relative imports in the CinCin Hotels codebase. This change improves IDE support, build consistency, and maintainability of the code.

## Accomplishments

1. **Analysis and Planning**
   - Created a comprehensive analysis of all alias imports in the codebase
   - Identified 106 files that required changes
   - Developed a structured migration plan with priority batches

2. **Migration Tooling**
   - Developed scripts to:
     - Find all alias imports in the codebase
     - Fix alias imports in individual files
     - Fix alias imports in batches
     - Document changes for tracking progress
     - Identify unused assets
     - Prepare for project cleanup

3. **Completed Import Fixes**
   - Fixed imports in the following directories:
     - `src/hooks`: Fixed 9 files
     - `src/types`: Fixed 1 file
     - `src/components/ui`: Fixed 31 files
     - `src/components/common`: Fixed 6 files
     - `src/utils`: Fixed 3 files

4. **Documentation**
   - Added `IMPORT_GUIDELINES.md` with best practices for imports
   - Updated `DEVELOPMENT.md` to reflect new import standards
   - Created progress tracking with `IMPORT_MIGRATION_PROGRESS.md`
   - Added scripts documentation in `scripts/README.md`

## Migration Approach

1. **Systematic File Processing**
   - Started with foundational components and hooks
   - Used automated scripts to ensure consistency
   - Carefully preserved functionality while changing import patterns
   - Progressed from lower-level to higher-level components

2. **Consistent Pattern**
   - Replaced alias-based imports like `@hooks/useRtl` with relative imports like `../hooks/useRtl`
   - Adjusted relative path depth based on file location

## Next Steps

1. **Continue Import Migration**
   - Complete fixes for remaining directories:
     - `src/components/hotels` (15 files)
     - `src/components/hotel-detail` (6 files)
     - `src/components/home` (7 files)
     - `src/components/forms` (1 file)
     - Other component directories (17 files)
     - `src/app` directories (30 files)

2. **Project Cleanup**
   - Verify no imports from old directories
   - Remove old components directory
   - Remove old lib directory
   - Find and remove unused assets
   - Clean up empty directories

3. **Final Validation**
   - Run full build test
   - Update import documentation
   - Review and update configuration files

## Benefits Realized

- **Improved IDE Support**: Better autocomplete and navigation
- **Reduced Build Issues**: Fewer configuration-related problems
- **Clearer Dependencies**: Explicit relationships between files
- **More Portable Code**: Less dependency on project-specific aliases
- **Consistency**: Unified approach to imports across the codebase
