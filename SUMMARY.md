## Structure Overview

The Directus CMS is set up with the following main collections:

- **hotels**: Main hotels collection
- **destinations**: Destinations collection
- **categories**: Categories for hotels and destinations
- **rooms**: Rooms collection linked to hotels
- **pages**: Content pages

Each of these has associated translation collections (e.g., hotels_translations) that contain language-specific fields like:
- name
- description
- short_description
- slug

## Current Status

- âœ… Directus is running successfully on http://localhost:8055
- âœ… API tokens are properly configured and working
- âœ… Can access all collections with proper permissions
- âœ… Translation system is set up with multiple languages

## Next Steps

1. **ðŸ”„ Integration with Next.js**
   - Update the Next.js application to use the real Directus API
   - Replace mock data with actual API calls
   - Implement proper error handling for API failures

2. **ðŸ”„ Translation Implementation**
   - Implement language switching in the UI
   - Ensure proper fallback when translations are missing

3. **ðŸ”„ Image Management**
   - Set up the correct image handling from Directus assets
   - Implement responsive image loading

4. **ðŸ”„ Data Management**
   - Create additional scripts for data export/import
   - Set up data backups

## Useful Commands

- **Start Directus**: `npm run directus:dev`
- **Stop Directus**: `npm run directus:stop`
- **Start Next.js**: `npm run dev`
- **Run Directus Setup**: `node setup-directus-combined.js`

## Notes

- When accessing translation fields, remember to use the appropriate translation collection (e.g., `hotels_translations`) rather than the main collection
- The admin credentials are: admin@cincinhotels.com / admin123
- API tokens are stored in .env.local
