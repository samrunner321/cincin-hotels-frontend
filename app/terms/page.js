          <p>
            CinCin Hotels acts as a platform connecting users with Hotel Partners. When you make a reservation through our Services, you are entering into a contract directly with the Hotel Partner, not with CinCin Hotels.

          <h3>3.2 Booking Confirmation</h3>
          <p>
            A booking is only confirmed after you receive a booking confirmation from us or the Hotel Partner. Before confirmation, room availability and rates are subject to change.
          </p>
          
          <h3>3.3 Payment</h3>
          <p>
            Payment terms vary depending on the Hotel Partner's policies. These terms will be clearly communicated during the booking process.
          </p>
          
          <h3>3.4 Cancellations and Modifications</h3>
          <p>
            Cancellation and modification policies are set by each Hotel Partner and will be displayed during the booking process. It is your responsibility to review these policies before completing a booking.
