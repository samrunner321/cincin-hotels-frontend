| RTL language support | ‚úÖ | Added support for Arabic (ar) and Hebrew (he) |
| Base components RTL support | ‚úÖ | BaseTable, BaseTabs, and form components updated |
| RTL-specific unit tests | ‚úÖ | Created tests for all critical components |
| Visual regression tests | ‚úÖ | Added Playwright tests for RTL layouts |
| Documentation | ‚úÖ | Updated RTL_SUPPORT.md with implementation details |
| Quality check | ‚úÖ | All critical components support RTL |

### Missing RTL Support

All critical components have RTL support! üéâ

## Recommendations

Based on the current implementation status, we recommend:

1. Continue monitoring RTL support in new components
2. Add RTL language options to the language switcher UI
3. Conduct user testing with native RTL language speakers
4. Implement automated RTL QA checks in the CI pipeline

## Next Steps

The next phase of RTL implementation (Sub-Batch 6.4) will focus on:

1. Comprehensive end-to-end testing for RTL flows
2. Performance optimizations for RTL rendering
3. Extending RTL support to additional components
4. Adding specialized components for RTL-specific features

## Conclusion

The implementation of RTL support in Sub-Batch 6.3 has been successful, with all critical components now properly supporting right-to-left text direction. The codebase now has a solid foundation for bidirectional text support, allowing for better internationalization and accessibility for users of RTL languages.
